# SoccerData
SkillCorner has very cool game tracking data! We will try our best to visualize it ;)

*HeadsUp: This is more of a practice project for us to dive in and learn some data viz/webapp development along the way!!!*

## STAR
Situation: Some players make more effort, which might get overlooked.
Task: We will try to find out which players run more by looking at their position data and highlight them.
Action: Data analysis; python/flask backend + html/css/js frontend
Result: to be implemented

## Features
- Colors separating the players and the ball
- Control of frames using slider

~~The Real STAR: We don't know a lot of coding -> Learn coding by diving in -> We learn it -> This~~

## Planned Updates
- Differentiation of teams as well as identification of individual players.
- More intuitive frame control mechanisms, such as typing in certain frames or using timestamps rather than frames.
- Video playback of chosen excerpts.
- Saving of images, gifs, or videos.
- Usage of the Kloppy resource provided by SkillCorner to make use of a visualizer much better suited for the data.
- Usage of data other than location such as ball possession, goals made, and total score to give a fully-fledged overview of the game.
