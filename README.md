# SoccerData
SkillCorner has very cool game tracking data! We will try our best to visualize it ;)

*HeadsUp: This is more of a practice project for us to dive in and learn some data viz/webapp development along the way!!!*

## STAR
Situation: Some players make more effort, which might get overlooked.
Task: We will try to find out which players run more by looking at their position data and highlight them.
Action: Data analysis; python/flask backend + html/css/js frontend
Result: to be implemented

## Features
- Colors separating the players and the ball
- Indicating where the 1st quarter ends and 2nd quarter begins*
- Data preprocessing: Get rid of all the frames where the ball isn't visible*
- and more...!

*may not be implemented yet
~~The Real STAR: We don't know a lot of coding -> Learn coding by diving in -> We learn it -> This~~
